Constructing F = (I - h delta):

From (delta x)_i = 1/2A sum_j (cot(alpha_j) + cot(beta_j)) (x_j - x_i),
     (delta x)_i = 1/2A [sum_j (cot(alpha_j) + cot(beta_j)) x_j - x_i * sum_j (cot(alpha_j) + cot(beta_j))]

Thus we want the neighbors of x_i to have a matrix element of 1/2A(cot(alpha_j) + cot(beta_j)) and x_i itself to have a matrix element
of -1/2A * sum_j (cot(alpha_j) + cot(beta_j)).

cot(theta) = cos(theta)/sin(theta) = a . b / ||a x b||, if a and b are the two vectors that form the angle theta.


Hitting the spacebar causes the smoothing (with command-line argument h) to be called.
